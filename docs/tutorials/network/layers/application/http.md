### HTTP Full

**HTTP** stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. It is invented by Tim Berner. HyperText is the type of text which is specially coded with the help of some standard coding language called [HyperText Markup Language (HTML)](../../../programm/html/intro-html.md). **HTTP/2** is the successor version of **HTTP**, which was published on May **2015**. **HTTP/3** is the latest version of HTTP, which is published in 2022.

The protocols that are used to transfer hypertext between two computers is known as *HyperText Transfer Protocol*. 
**HTTP provides** standard between a web browser and web server to establish communication. It is set of rules for transferring data from one computer to another. Data such as text, images, and other multimedia files are shared on the World Wide Web. Whenever a web user opens their web browser, user indirectly uses HTTP. It is an application protocol which is used for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. 

How it works ? 
First of all, whenever we want to open any website then first we open web browser after that we will type URL of that website (e.g., www.barca.com ). This URL is now sent to Domain Name Server (DNS). Then *DNS* first check records for this `URL` in their database, then *DNS* will return **IP address** to web browser corresponding to this `URL`. Now browser is able to sent request to actual server. 

After server sends data to client, connection will be closed. If we want something else from server we should have to re-establish connection between client and server.
